## Civic Sandbox Backend 

This repo was built off of Hack Oregon's Backend Exemplar (details on contributers and history below). 


## Contributors and History

This repo represents the work of many members of the Hack Oregon project team. The roots of this work began with the [2017 backend-service-pattern](https://github.com/hackoregon/backend-service-pattern), the work of the DevOps and platform teams, and the APIs deployed for the 2017 seasons.

This current implementation builds on the [transportation-system-backend](https://github.com/hackoregon/transportation-system-backend) and [passenger_census_api](https://github.com/hackoregon/passenger_census_api). The database structure is an implementation of the PostGIS container of the **data-science-pet-containers** repo.
